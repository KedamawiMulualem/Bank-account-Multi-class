  any number of Account instances, but no account holder can have multiple accounts of any type
  (that is, no one will have two checking accounts)

acctType is a char indicated with the following key:
C=checking
S=savings

B=business account

  Note that a BankHolder may have 0 - 3 accounts.  Business account holders only have
  1 account.  Some BankHolders haven't completed their applications and will have 0
  accounts at this time.
